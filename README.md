Created to understand github tutorial

Hello!

mridhoputra here, I like Java and developing android software.

In this meantime, it's been 2 years i've learned about Java language programming, and used Java to create 3 projects that i would like to publish next after this tutorial.

Meanwhile, i also took interest in developing android software, with 2 simple projects i have created, i would like to publish them too.

Anyway, thanks for reading this :D
